# CompileDriver
Abridged C compiler and interpreter.  My focus is code practice on an interesting, open ended and challenging problem. Please keep that in mind when you see in the code that I also wrote my own file parser. I understand that if this were any kind of commercial project or something beyond a learning exercise, I would use what's already available and not "re-invent the wheel".

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/swagenVolk/CompileDriver/wiki) for more comprehensive and up-to-date info.
